Lexilla is on GitHub at https://github.com/ScintillaOrg/lexilla

Bugs, fixes and features should be posted to the Issue Tracker
https://github.com/ScintillaOrg/lexilla/issues

Patches should include test cases. Add a test case file in 
lexilla/test/examples/<language> and run the test program in 
lexilla/test.
The result will be a new file with ".new" appended containing
brace surrounded style numbers for each style start as markup:
{5}import{0} {11}contextlib{0}
To build lexilla and the tests with gcc there are Windows batch\
and Unix shell files scripts/RunTest.bat scripts/RunTest.sh.
Check the result of the .new file and, if correct, rename replacing
".new" with ".styled". Run the tests again and success should be reported.
Include the .styled file in the patch.
Including test cases ensures that the change won't be undone by
other changes in the future and clarifies the intentions of the author.

Either send unified diffs (or patch files) or zip archives with whole files.
Mercurial/Git patch files are best as they include author information and commit
messages.

Questions should go to the scintilla-interest mailing list
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scintilla-interest

Code should follow the guidelines at

Lexilla is on GitHub so use its facilities rather than SourceForge which is
the home of Scintilla.
The neilh @ scintilla.org account receives much spam and is only checked
occasionally. Almost all Scintilla mail should go to the mailing list.
